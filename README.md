# Target-Dataset-Scaler-SQL-Project-
I completed a Scaler SQL project using a target dataset to solve real-world analyst questions. By writing optimized SQL queries, I extracted, transformed, and analyzed data to deliver insights. The project addressed business-critical queries, revealing trends, performance metrics, and actionable recommendations to support decision-making.
